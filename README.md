# **JustTweet (React.js Project)**

### **Technologies**: React.js, React-Bootstrap, MongoDB  
**Duration**: April 2023 - May 2023

---

## **Project Overview**
**JustTweet** is a social media-like web application that allows users to create, view, and interact with tweets in real-time. The application leverages the power of React.js for the front-end, React-Bootstrap for a responsive UI, and MongoDB for data management and storage.

---

## **Key Features and Contributions**

### 1. **Tweet Creation**
- Designed a form that enables users to compose and post tweets.
- Tweets are stored in a **MongoDB database**, ensuring persistent storage.

### 2. **Tweet Counter**
- Implemented a real-time tweet counter that updates dynamically as tweets are added.
- The counter fetches data directly from MongoDB to reflect the current count.

### 3. **Tweet Retrieval**
- Integrated functionality to fetch and display individual tweets from MongoDB.
- Utilized React components for efficient rendering of tweets on the front-end.

### 4. **Responsive UI**
- Leveraged **React-Bootstrap** to create a responsive layout compatible with desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Ensured the application adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes.

### 5. **Component Composition**
- Employed React's component composition to structure the project efficiently.
- Used mapping techniques to render lists of tweets dynamically, promoting maintainable and reusable code.

## **Getting Started with Create React App**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### **Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature.

### **Learn More**

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
